##  Overview
NEW YORK – Text set in all caps gets converted to small-caps by default. This means that acronyms like BBC don’t stand out relative to the rest of the text. Acronyms even work with accents like ÀÊØ. A possessive [acronym](/) like CNN's opinion works as well. What about the FCC! The so called (BBC). Also I automatically convert three dots to an ellipsis... « Hello » there should have non-breaking spaces between the punctuation and the word...

## Installation
Accents all work perfectly in Georgia. Al­brecht Dürer, François Truf­faut, Plácido Domingo should all render appropriately. Cause célèbre, piña co­lada, Göt­ter­däm­merung straße all work too. Links also are improved: note how the [descenders get cleared](/) from the underline stroke. Composing content for the web is complicated because the designer has no control over the dimensions of the screen on which the content will be viewed?

## Configuration
"Hanging quotes and smart quotes." Blot will convert primes and basic quotes automatically. All you have to do is type using primes (\') and inch marks (\") and "everything" looks lovely. "Better than a 65'6" whale." – Captain Ahab. "It's my '#1' choice!" – 12" Foam Finger from '93. You can put acronyms and quotes safely inside code blocks too:

```javascript
foo("bar"); // Won't have smart quotes or auto ACR...
```

## Usage
While I was in the mood for XML I added a site map to each blog and a text file so Google can index your posts easily. Does out text actually get struck out? Looks like it does. Hello is a designer and writer. Recent work has touched on a range of topics, including the relationship of movement and interaction, the history of visual identity and branding in the arts, and the future of the museum in the digital age. His essay on the rise of graphic design MFA programs, "School Days" was dope?

## Summary
Hello is a designer and writer. Recent work has touched on a range of topics, including the relationship of movement and interaction, the history of visual identity and branding in the arts, and the future of the museum in the digital age. His essay on the rise of graphic design MFA programs, "School Days" was dope. Thank you Twitter and your emoji project. Also, I made the descenders on links more pretty – look how they don’t overlap with the underline. The emoji extractor ignores some unicode characters, like these ones.

## Knuth
Thus, I came to the conclusion that the designer of a new
system must not only be the implementer and first
large||scale user; the designer should also write the first
user manual.

The separation of any of these four components would have
hurt \TeX\ significantly. If I had not participated fully in
all these activities, literally hundreds of improvements
would never have been made, because I would never have
thought of them or perceived why they were important.

But a system cannot be successful if it is too strongly
influenced by a single person. Once the initial design is
complete and fairly robust, the real test begins as people
with many different viewpoints undertake their own
experiments.
