    <p>NEW YORK – Text set in all caps gets converted to small-caps by
    default. This means that acronyms like BBC don’t stand out relative
    to the rest of the text. Acronyms even work with accents like ÀÊØ. A
    possessive <a href="/">acronym</a> like CNN’s opinion works as well.
    What about the FCC! The so called (BBC). Also I automatically
    convert three dots to an ellipsis… « Hello » there should have
    non-breaking spaces between the punctuation and the word…</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Accents all work perfectly in Georgia. Al­brecht Dürer, François
    Truf­faut, Plácido Domingo should all render appropriately. Cause
    célèbre, piña co­lada, Göt­ter­däm­merung straße all work too. Links
    also are improved: note how the <a href="/">descenders get
    cleared</a> from the underline stroke. Composing content for the web
    is complicated because the designer has no control over the
    dimensions of the screen on which the content will be viewed?</p>
    <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
    <p>“Hanging quotes and smart quotes.” Blot will convert primes and
    basic quotes automatically. All you have to do is type using primes
    (') and inch marks (") and “everything” looks lovely. “Better than a
    65’6” whale.” – Captain Ahab. “It’s my ‘#1’ choice!” – 12” Foam
    Finger from ’93. You can put acronyms and quotes safely inside code
    blocks too:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
    class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">foo</span>(<span class="st">&quot;bar&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// Won&#39;t have smart quotes or auto ACR...</span></span></code></pre></div>
    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>While I was in the mood for XML I added a site map to each blog
    and a text file so Google can index your posts easily. Does out text
    actually get struck out? Looks like it does. Hello is a designer and
    writer. Recent work has touched on a range of topics, including the
    relationship of movement and interaction, the history of visual
    identity and branding in the arts, and the future of the museum in
    the digital age. His essay on the rise of graphic design MFA
    programs, “School Days” was dope?</p>

    Thank you Twitter and your emoji project. Also, I made the
    descenders on links more pretty – look how they don’t overlap with
    the underline. The emoji extractor ignores some unicode characters,
    like these ones.</p>
    <h2 id="knuth">Knuth</h2>
    <p>Thus, I came to the conclusion that the designer of a new system
    must not only be the implementer and first large||scale user; the
    designer should also write the first user manual.</p>
    <p>The separation of any of these four components would have hurt
     significantly. If I had not participated fully in all these
    activities, literally hundreds of improvements would never have been
    made, because I would never have thought of them or perceived why
    they were important.</p>
    <p>But a system cannot be successful if it is too strongly
    influenced by a single person. Once the initial design is complete
    and fairly robust, the real test begins as people with many
    different viewpoints undertake their own experiments.</p>
