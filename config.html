    <p>This nation, turning 100 years old, had no {}, no St.~George
    slaying the dragon, no Prometheus. The emerging American genius for
    making a lot of money was a poor substitute for King Arthur and his
    knights (although the Horatio Alger myth of rags to riches was good
    for a lot of mileage). Without a mythology and set of ancient heroes
    to call its own, America had to manufacture its heroes. So the
    mythmaking machinery of nineteenth|-|century American media created
    a suitable heroic archetype in the cowboys of the Wild West. The
    image was of the undaunted cattle drivers living a life of reckless
    individualism, braving the elements, staving off brutal Indian
    attacks. Or of heroic lawmen dueling with six|-|guns in the streets
    at high noon. This artificial Wild West became America’s Iliad.

    <p>But if you place a human brain, with its evolutionary mandate to
    adapt to its environment, in an environment where there is no
    obvious linear sequence, where facts can be accessed at random,
    where everything is reversible, where the gap between stimulus and
    response is minimal, and above all where time is short, then your
    train of thought could be derailed. Add in the sensory distractions
    of an all|-|encompassing and vivid audio|-|visual universe
    encouraging shorter spans for sustained attention, and you might
    become, as it were, a computer yourself: a system responding
    efficiently and processing information very well, but devoid of
    deeper thought. –Greenfield</p>
