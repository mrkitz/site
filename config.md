This nation, turning 100 years old, had no {\em Odyssey}, no
St.~George slaying the dragon, no Prometheus. The emerging American
genius for making a lot of money was a poor substitute for King
Arthur and his knights (although the Horatio Alger myth of rags to
riches was good for a lot of mileage). Without a mythology and set
of ancient heroes to call its own, America had to manufacture its
heroes. So the mythmaking machinery of nineteenth|-|century American
media created a suitable heroic archetype in the cowboys of the Wild
West. The image was of the undaunted cattle drivers living a life of
reckless individualism, braving the elements, staving off brutal
Indian attacks. Or of heroic lawmen dueling with six|-|guns in the
streets at high noon. This artificial Wild West became America's
Iliad. --Davis

But if you place a human brain, with its evolutionary mandate to adapt to its
environment, in an environment where there is no obvious linear sequence, where
facts can be accessed at random, where everything is reversible, where the gap
between stimulus and response is minimal, and above all where time is short, then
your train of thought could be derailed. Add in the sensory distractions of an
all|-|encompassing and vivid audio|-|visual universe encouraging shorter spans
for sustained attention, and you might become, as it were, a computer yourself: a
system responding efficiently and processing information very well, but devoid of
deeper thought.  --Greenfield
